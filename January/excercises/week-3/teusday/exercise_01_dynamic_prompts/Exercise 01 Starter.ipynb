            "In Python, a **decorator** is a design pattern that modifies or enhances functions or methods without altering their actual code. They allow you to add functionality to existing functions in a clean and reusable way.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Concepts:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **First-Class Functions**: In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This characteristic allows decorators to take a function as input.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Syntax**: Decorators use the `@decorator_name` syntax to apply them to a function.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Function Wrapping**: A typical decorator function defines an inner function (often called a wrapper) that adds functionality before or after the original function call.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example:\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a simple example of a decorator:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "def my_decorator(func):\n",
            "    def wrapper():\n",
            "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
            "        func()  # Call the original function\n",
            "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
            "    return wrapper\n",
            "\n",
            "@my_decorator\n",
            "def say_hello():\n",
            "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
            "\n",
            "# Calling the decorated function\n",
            "say_hello()\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Output:\n",
            "```\n",
            "Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
            "Hello!\n",
            "Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Use Cases:\n",
            "- **Logging**: To log function calls and their results.\n",
            "- **Access Control**: To restrict access to certain functions based on user permissions.\n",
            "- **Caching**: To cache results of expensive function calls to improve performance.\n",
            "- **Input/Output Modification**: To modify input arguments and/or output results.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion:\n",
            "Decorators provide a way to enhance function behavior in a modular way, promoting code reusability and cleaner separation of concerns.\n",

            "\n",

            "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. Decorators are commonly used to add functionality, such as logging, access control, or input validation, without altering the actual code of the function itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How Decorators Work\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Function as First-Class Objects**: Functions in Python are first-class objects, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Higher-Order Functions**: A decorator is typically a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that adds some additional behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Syntax**: You can apply decorators using the `@decorator_name` syntax placed above the function definition they modify.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s a simple example to illustrate how decorators work:\n",
            "\n",

            "def my_decorator(func):\n",

            "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
            "        func()\n",
            "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
            "    return wrapper\n",
            "\n",
            "@my_decorator\n",
            "def say_hello():\n",
            "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
            "\n",
            "say_hello()\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Output:\n",
            "```\n",
            "Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
            "Hello!\n",
            "Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Explanation:\n",
            "- The `my_decorator` function takes `say_hello` as an argument and wraps its functionality with additional print statements to demonstrate behavior before and after calling the function.\n",
            "- When `say_hello()` is invoked, the output includes messages that are added by the decorator along with the original function's output.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Use Cases:\n",
            "- **Logging**: Automatically log function calls and their parameters.\n",
            "- **Access Control**: Check user permissions before executing a function.\n",
            "- **Caching**: Store results of expensive function calls to avoid recalculating.\n",
            "- **Timing**: Measure the execution time of a function.\n",
            "\n",
            "Decorators enhance code reusability and maintainability by allowing you to separate different functionalities and keep your code clean.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "INTERMEDIATE response:\n",
            "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "In Python, a **decorator** is a design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class method. Decorators are implemented as higher-order functions, meaning they take a function as an argument and return a new function that enhances or alters the original function's behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Points:\n",
            "1. **Function as First-Class Citizens**: Functions in Python can be passed around as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This is foundational for decorators.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Syntax**: Decorators are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition. For example:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   @my_decorator\n",
            "   def my_function():\n",
            "       pass\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Creating a Decorator**: A basic decorator can be created as follows:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   def my_decorator(func):\n",
            "       def wrapper():\n",
            "           print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
            "           func()\n",
            "           print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
            "       return wrapper\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Using the Decorator**: When the decorated function is called, it executes the wrapper function instead:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   @my_decorator\n",
            "   def say_hello():\n",
            "       print(\"Hello!\")\n",
            "\n",
            "   say_hello()\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   **Output:**\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
            "   Hello!\n",
            "   Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Decorators with Arguments**: You can also create decorators that accept arguments by adding an extra nested function.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Common Use Cases**: Decorators are often used for logging, enforcing access control, memoization, and measuring execution time.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion:\n",
            "Decorators are a powerful feature that enhance the modularity and readability of code by allowing you to augment functions in a clean and expressive way without modifying their original structure.\n"

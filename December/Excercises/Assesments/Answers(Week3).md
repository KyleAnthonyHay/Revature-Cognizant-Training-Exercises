Q1:

A vector database captures the semantic meaning of data as high-dimensional vectors using embeddings. <br>
A relational database stores data in tables and uses exact matching with SQL queries. Vector databases search by "semantic similarity" and can return multiple results.

Q2:

Embedding is the process of representing dat as a high dimentional numerical vector. This allows data with similar semantic meaning to have similar vectors.

Q3:

- In-memory: Ephemeral, only keeps data while the program is running
- PersistentClient: Data is saved to disk
- HttpClient: this connects to a remote chroma sever over HTTP.

Q4:

Regularization Analysis
==================================================

1. Which technique was most effective alone?
   -> Early stopping was most effective: Val Accuracy: 0.8600

2. Did combining techniques help?
   -> no because the combined approach result is: Val Accuracy: 0.8400

3. What was the train/val gap for each?
Task 3.1: Baseline (Overfitting)
Train Accuracy: 1.0000
Val Accuracy:   0.8300
Gap:            0.1700
Task 3.2: Dropout
Train Accuracy: 0.9950
Val Accuracy:   0.8500
Gap:            0.1450
Note that the dropout regularization did not fix the overfiting problem
Task 3.3: L2 Regularization
Train Accuracy: 1.0000
Val Accuracy:   0.8400
Gap:            0.1600
Note that the L2 regularization also did not fix the overfiting problem!
Task 3.4: Early Stopping
Stopped at epoch: 14
Train Accuracy: 1.0000
Val Accuracy:   0.8600
Gap:            0.1400
Note that the early stopping was the most effective but it still did not fix the overfiting problem
Task 3.5: Combined Regularization
Stopped at epoch: 65
Train Accuracy: 1.0000
Val Accuracy:   0.8400
Gap:            0.1600

4. What's the tradeoff between regularization and model capacity?
   -> More regularization = lower train acc but better generalization
